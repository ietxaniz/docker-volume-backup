# Automated Backup Process Documentation

## Backup Configuration Structure

The backup configuration will be defined in a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
backupDefinitions:
  - name: "backup1"
    type: "standard"
    containers:
      - "container1"
      - "container2"
    volumes:
      - "volume1"
      - "volume2"
  - name: "backup2"
    type: "postgresqldatabase"
    containers:
      - "postgres_container"
    volumes: []
```

## Backup Process Workflow

The general workflow for the automated backup process will be as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Backup Process] --> B[Load Backup Configurations]
    B --> C[For Each Backup Definition]
    C --> D{Determine Backup Type}
    D -->|Standard| E[Standard Backup Process]
    D -->|PostgreSQL Database| F[PostgreSQL Backup Process]
    E --> G[Encrypt Backup Data]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Upload to S3]
    H --> I{More Backup Definitions?}
    I -->|Yes| C
    I -->|No| J[End Backup Process]
```

### Standard Backup Process

For standard backups, the process will be:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Standard Backup] --> B[Stop Associated Containers]
    B --> C[Create Backup with volume-backup.sh]
    C --> D[Start Containers]
    D --> E[End Standard Backup]
```

### PostgreSQL Database Backup Process

For PostgreSQL database backups, the process will be:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start PostgreSQL Backup] --> B[Execute pg_dump in Container]
    B --> C[End PostgreSQL Backup]
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Configuration Parsing**: Implement YAML parsing to read the backup configurations.
2. **Backup Type Handling**: Create separate functions or modules for each backup type (standard, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the process.
4. **Scheduling**: Consider implementing a scheduling mechanism to run backups at specified intervals.
5. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring and alerting for backup failures or issues.
6. **Encryption**: Ensure all backups are encrypted before being uploaded to S3.
7. **S3 Integration**: Implement secure and efficient uploading to S3, including handling large files.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the configuration file structure and parsing.
2. Develop the main backup orchestration logic.
3. Implement the standard backup process using existing scripts.
4. Develop the PostgreSQL backup process.
5. Integrate encryption and S3 uploading.
6. Add scheduling capabilities.
7. Implement logging and monitoring.
8. Test thoroughly with various backup scenarios.
