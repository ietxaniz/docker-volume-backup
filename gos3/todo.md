## Functionalities to implement

- [x] List s3 content
- [x] Call to any of scripts folder script (using exec package)
- [ ] Upload data to s3
- [ ] Service
    - [ ] Automatic backups at certain hours of day
        - [ ] Configuration file with containers and associated volumes
        - [ ] Stops container
        - [ ] Makes a copy of the data: volume-backup.sh
        - [ ] Starts container
        - [ ] Encripts all generated data
        - [ ] Generates a folder with combination of date and backup name on s3
        - [ ] Uploads all encrypted data
    - [ ] Delete old redundant backups. Maintaining a predefined patter (for example first of last 6 months, first of last 4 weeks and last 5 days)
- [ ] Add a logging sytem to track backup operations, errors, and performance metrics.
- [ ] Implement alerts. For backup failures, etc...
- [ ] Develop a centralized system that can aggregate logs and status reports from all ownsers instances using this service.
- [ ] Backup verification. Add backup verification functionality.
- [ ] Retry mechanism. Implement a retry system for failed backups or uploads.
- [ ] Resource management. Add checks to ensure sufficient disk space before starting backups.
- [ ] Restore testing. Periodically test restore process to ensure backups are valid and restorable. (Perhaps this needs to be manual as private key is stored with a secret)
